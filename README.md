Pixel manipulation is a technique used in image encryption to scramble and conceal the original image data. This involves altering the pixels that make up the image, rearranging them or replacing them with new ones, to create a cryptic representation of the original image. By manipulating the pixels, the image becomes unreadable to the human eye, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to access the information. This technique is often used in combination with other encryption methods, such as cryptography, to provide an additional layer of security. The process of pixel manipulation can be reversed to restore the original image, allowing authorized parties to access the encrypted data. This technique has various applications in fields like data security, digital watermarking, and image privacy.
